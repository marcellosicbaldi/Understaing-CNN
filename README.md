# Understanding Convolutional Neural Networks

The aim of this notebook is to visualize what convolutional layers see.

## Results

This brief experiment shows that feature maps closer to the input of the model capture a lot of fine detail in the image while as we progress deeper into the model, the feature maps show less and less detail. This pattern was to be expected, as the model abstracts the features from the image into more general concepts that can be used to make a classification.
